                Stores key/value pairs in the browser's storage, and persists
                even after the user closes the browser window or navigates away
                from the site. The data is associated with a specific domain and
                is not shared across different domains. localStorage can store
                more data than cookies, typically up to 5-10 MB.

                Similar to localStorage, but the data is only accessible for the
                duration of the browser session (i.e. until the user closes the
                browser window or tab). The data is also associated with a
                specific domain and is not shared across different domains.
                sessionStorage can store more data than cookies, typically up to

                Stores small amounts of data in the browser's storage, typically
                limited to 4 KB per cookie. Cookies can be set with an
                expiration time and can be accessed by both the server and the
                client, making them useful for storing user-specific data or
                tracking user behavior across multiple sessions or sites.

          3. What is Event loop in javascript and How its works?
        </h1>

        <h3 class="text-sm text-green-600">
          Answer:
          <span class="text-black">
            The event loop is a key concept in JavaScript that allows the
            language to handle asynchronous events in a non-blocking way. It is
            essentially a loop that continuously checks the JavaScript runtime's
            call stack and task queue, and executes tasks in the task queue when
            the call stack is empty.

            <h4 class="text-green-600">
              How it Work:
              <ul class="text-black space-y-0.5 mt-1.5">
                <li>
                  1. The event loop continuously checks the call stack to see if
                  there are any functions that need to be executed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  2. If the call stack is empty, the event loop looks for any
                  pending events or callbacks in the event queue.
                </li>
                <li>
                  3. If there are any events or callbacks in the queue, the
                  event loop takes the first one and pushes it onto the call
                  stack.
                </li>
                <li>
                  4. The function associated with the event or callback is then
                  executed.
                </li>

                <li>
                  5. If the function is asynchronous, it may register a new
                  event or callback with the event loop and return immediately.
                </li>

                <li>
                  6. The event loop then repeats this process, checking the call
                  stack for any pending functions and processing any events or
                  callbacks in the queue.
                </li>
              </ul>

        The quizTimer() and chooseQuiz() functions are explained here
      </h1>

      <div class="mt-6">
        <h2>1. What is the purpose of quizTimer() function?</h2>
        <h3 class="text-green-600 mt-3 space-y-3">
          Answer:
          <p class="text-black">
            The purpose of the quizTimer function is to display a timer that
            counts up from 0 seconds and updates every second. It does this by
            using the setInterval method to call an anonymous function that
            updates the timer HTML element with the current time every second.
          </p>
          <p class="text-black">
            The function takes one parameter dismiss, which is a boolean value.
            If dismiss is true, it clears the timer using the clearInterval
            method and stops the timer from running. This is useful when the
            timer needs to be stopped manually, for example when the quiz is
            over or the user has clicked a "Submit" button.
          </p>
          <p class="text-black">
            The function also adds a visual effect to the timer by changing the
            color of the text every 60 seconds. If the seconds count is a
            multiple of 60, it toggles the color of the text between two shades
            of red by adding or removing CSS classes from the HTML element. This
            is a nice touch to add some visual interest to the timer and keep
            the user engaged.
          </p>

      </div>

      <div class="mt-6">
        <h2>2. What is the purpose of chooseQuiz() function?</h2>

        <h3 class="text-green-600 mt-3 space-y-3">
          Answer:

          <p class="text-black">
            The purpose of the <strong>chooseQuiz</strong> function is to handle
            the user's selection of a quiz answer and store the selected answer
            in an <strong>answers</strong> array. The function takes two
            parameters: <strong>index</strong>, which is the index of the
            current quiz question in the <strong>quizData</strong> array, and
            <strong>givenAns</strong>, which is the answer chosen by the user.
          </p>

          <p class="text-black">
            The function first checks whether there is already an answer stored
            for the current quiz question by using the
            <strong>find</strong> method to search the
            <strong>answers</strong> array for an object with the same
            <strong>id</strong> as the current quiz question. If an answer
            object already exists, it updates the
            <strong>givenAns</strong> property of that object with the user's
            new answer using the <strong>splice</strong> method to replace the
            existing object with a new object that has the updated
            <strong>givenAns</strong>
            property. If an answer object does not exist, it creates a new
            object with the <strong>id</strong>, <strong>question</strong>, and
            <strong>givenAns</strong> properties and pushes it into the
            <strong>answers</strong>
            array.
          </p>

          <p class="text-black">
            After updating the <strong>answers</strong> array, the function
            calls <strong>displayAnswers</strong> to update the display of the
            quiz answers. This function is not shown in the code provided, but
            it likely takes the <strong>answers</strong> array and generates
            HTML to display the user's chosen answers for each quiz question.
